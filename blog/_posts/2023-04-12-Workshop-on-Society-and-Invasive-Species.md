Workshop on society and invasive species: registration/contributed presentation submission open

Environmental Conflicts, Social Structures and Invasive Species Control
Tuesday, June 13–Wednesday, June 14, 2023
Online and in Nantes, France

This two-day workshop will focus on the control of invasive species in complex and conflictual social contexts.

The workshop aims to bring together empirical researchers, environmental professionals and theoreticians to share perspectives on invasive species control in a social context. It will emphasize management in the face of disparate interests as well as nonviolent or violent conflicts. With participants from diverse parts of the globe, the workshop aims to help form interdisciplinary connections that lead to relevant research and effective social and environmental interventions.

The workshop  will take place in a hybrid virtual and on-site format, with the on-site component at the Institute for Advanced Study–Nantes (IEA-Nantes), France. The languages of the conference are English and French, with interpretation available.

Organizers: Dr. Raphael Kweyu, Kenyatta University (Kenya) and IEA-Nantes; Prof. Judith Miller, Georgetown University (USA) and IEA-Nantes.
