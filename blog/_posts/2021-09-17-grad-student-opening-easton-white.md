The Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab (QMEL) at the University of New Hampshire is recruiting a MS or PhD student interested in using mathematical modeling or statistical tools to address issues related to the ocean. This work could involve metapopulation modeling, sustainable seafood, or the role of extreme events in marine systems. 

QMEL is run by Dr. Easton White and consists of scientists with a mix of mathematical and biological skillsets. Members of the lab are strongly committed to anti-racist practices, real diversity and inclusion efforts, and moving science beyond the ivory tower.
